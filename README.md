#User-Authentication-System repository is a back-end project primarily built using JavaScript and Node.js.This repository provides a complete implementation for user authentication in web applications. It includes features like user Registration, login, logout, Token verification, change password, and reset password.

I have used frameworks like Express.js, 
JSON Web Tokens for stateless authentication, 
and Bcrypt for password hashing.
