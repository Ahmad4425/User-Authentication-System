#User-Authentication-System repository is a back-end project primarily built using JavaScript and Node.js.This repository provides a complete implementation for user authentication in web applications. You can use the code given in this repository to authenticate users in any web application. It includes features like user registration, login, logout, Token verification, change password, and reset password.

I have used frameworks like Express.js, 

JSON Web Tokens for stateless authentication, 

and Bcrypt for password hashing.
